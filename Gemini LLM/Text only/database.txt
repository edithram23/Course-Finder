FAQ
What are State Space Models (SSM) in machine learning?
State Space Models (SSM) are used in machine learning to model and predict systems that evolve over time. They represent the system's state as a dynamic process, helping to capture temporal patterns in data, making them useful for tasks like time series forecasting, control systems, and natural language processing.
How do State Space Models differ from traditional RNNs?
State Space Models (SSM) and traditional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) both handle sequential data, but they differ in approach. SSMs use a mathematical framework to model the system's state and evolution over time explicitly. In contrast, RNNs use neural networks to implicitly learn patterns in sequences without explicitly modeling the system's state.
What is the Mamba architecture in AI?
Mamba is an alternative AI architecture designed to address the limitations of traditional transformers. It enhances efficiency with optimizations like RMSnorm and offers significant improvements in inference speed—up to 5× higher throughput. Mamba also scales linearly with sequence length, making it highly effective for handling real-world data, even with sequences up to a million tokens. As a versatile backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across various domains, including language, audio, and genomics. Notably, the Mamba-3B model outperforms transformers of the same size and rivals those twice its size in both pretraining and downstream evaluation.
How does Mamba compare to transformer models?
Mamba architecture differs from traditional transformer models by leveraging state-space models (SSMs) instead of the self-attention mechanism. This key difference allows Mamba to achieve linear complexity scaling with sequence length, a significant improvement over the quadratic scaling seen in transformers. While transformers excel in parallel processing with self-attention, Mamba's use of SSMs enables it to handle sequences more efficiently, especially in tasks involving long sequences, while still supporting parallel processing during training.
What are the applications of State Space Models in NLP?
State Space Models (SSM) are used in NLP for similar applications as other Language Models (LLMs), such as predicting and modeling sequential language patterns. However, SSMs stand out due to their ability to handle long text sequences more efficiently, making them particularly advantageous in tasks that involve processing extensive dependencies within the text.
How do transformers work in large language models?
Transformers use self-attention mechanisms to process input data in parallel, allowing large language models to efficiently learn relationships between words in a sequence, improving performance in tasks like translation and text generation.
Why are RNNs considered in AI despite transformer popularity?
RNNs are still used in AI because they excel at handling sequential data with strong temporal dependencies, and their simpler architecture can be advantageous in specific applications where transformers might be overkill.
What are the benefits of using Mamba in deep learning?
Mamba architecture offers improved efficiency in deep learning models, particularly in handling complex tasks and large-scale AI applications, making it a powerful alternative to traditional transformers.
How do State Space Models improve the accuracy of AI models, such as RNNs or Transformers in processing temporal data?
State Space Models improve AI accuracy by explicitly modeling the underlying state of a system over time, leading to better predictions and more interpretable results, especially in time-sensitive applications.

FAQ
What are State Space Models (SSM) in machine learning?
State Space Models (SSM) are used in machine learning to model and predict systems that evolve over time. They represent the system's state as a dynamic process, helping to capture temporal patterns in data, making them useful for tasks like time series forecasting, control systems, and natural language processing.
How do State Space Models differ from traditional RNNs?
State Space Models (SSM) and traditional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) both handle sequential data, but they differ in approach. SSMs use a mathematical framework to model the system's state and evolution over time explicitly. In contrast, RNNs use neural networks to implicitly learn patterns in sequences without explicitly modeling the system's state.
What is the Mamba architecture in AI?
Mamba is an alternative AI architecture designed to address the limitations of traditional transformers. It enhances efficiency with optimizations like RMSnorm and offers significant improvements in inference speed—up to 5× higher throughput. Mamba also scales linearly with sequence length, making it highly effective for handling real-world data, even with sequences up to a million tokens. As a versatile backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across various domains, including language, audio, and genomics. Notably, the Mamba-3B model outperforms transformers of the same size and rivals those twice its size in both pretraining and downstream evaluation.
How does Mamba compare to transformer models?
Mamba architecture differs from traditional transformer models by leveraging state-space models (SSMs) instead of the self-attention mechanism. This key difference allows Mamba to achieve linear complexity scaling with sequence length, a significant improvement over the quadratic scaling seen in transformers. While transformers excel in parallel processing with self-attention, Mamba's use of SSMs enables it to handle sequences more efficiently, especially in tasks involving long sequences, while still supporting parallel processing during training.
What are the applications of State Space Models in NLP?
State Space Models (SSM) are used in NLP for similar applications as other Language Models (LLMs), such as predicting and modeling sequential language patterns. However, SSMs stand out due to their ability to handle long text sequences more efficiently, making them particularly advantageous in tasks that involve processing extensive dependencies within the text.
How do transformers work in large language models?
Transformers use self-attention mechanisms to process input data in parallel, allowing large language models to efficiently learn relationships between words in a sequence, improving performance in tasks like translation and text generation.
Why are RNNs considered in AI despite transformer popularity?
RNNs are still used in AI because they excel at handling sequential data with strong temporal dependencies, and their simpler architecture can be advantageous in specific applications where transformers might be overkill.
What are the benefits of using Mamba in deep learning?
Mamba architecture offers improved efficiency in deep learning models, particularly in handling complex tasks and large-scale AI applications, making it a powerful alternative to traditional transformers.
How do State Space Models improve the accuracy of AI models, such as RNNs or Transformers in processing temporal data?
State Space Models improve AI accuracy by explicitly modeling the underlying state of a system over time, leading to better predictions and more interpretable results, especially in time-sensitive applications.

What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning is the science of teaching machines how to learn by themselves. Machine Learning is re-shaping and revolutionizing the world and disrupting industries and job functions globally. 
Machine learning is so extensive that you probably use it numerous times a day without even knowing it. From unlocking your mobile phones using your face to giving your attendance using a biometric machine, machine learning is being used in almost every stage. 
In this age of machine learning, every aspiring data scientist is expected to upskill themselves in machine learning techniques & tools and apply them in real-world business problems.
What are the applications of Machine Learning?
Now that you get the hang of it, you might be asking what are some of the examples of machine learning and how does it affect our life? Here are a few examples where we use the outcome of machine learning already:
Smartphones detecting faces while taking photos or unlocking themselves
Facebook, LinkedIn or any other social media site recommending your friends and ads you might be interested in
Amazon recommending you the products based on your browsing history
  Banks using Machine Learning to detect Fraud transactions in real-time
What kind of problems can be solved using Machine Learning?
Machine Learning problems can be divided into 3 broad classes:
Supervised Machine Learning
Unsupervised Machine Learning
Reinforcement Learning
Here is an illustration of these different machine learning problems:



Supervised Machine Learning: When you have past data with outcomes (labels in machine learning terminology) and you want to predict the outcomes for the future – you would use Supervised Machine Learning algorithms. Supervised Machine Learning problems can again be divided into 2 kinds of problems:
Classification Problems: When you want to classify outcomes into different classes. For example – whether a customer would default on their loan or not is a classification problem which is of high interest to any Bank
Regression Problem: When you are interested in answering how much – these problems would fall under the Regression umbrella. For example – what is the expected amount of default from a customer is a Regression problem

Unsupervised Machine Learning: There are times when you don’t want to exactly predict an Outcome. You just want to perform a segmentation or clustering. For example – a bank would want to have a segmentation of its customers to understand their behavior. This is an Unsupervised Machine Learning problem as we are not predicting any outcomes here.

Reinforcement Learning: It is said to be the hope of true artificial intelligence. And it is rightly said so because the potential that Reinforcement Learning possesses is immense. It is a slightly complex topic as compared to traditional machine learning but an equally crucial one for the future.

Common Questions Deep Learning Beginners Ask About PyTorch
What is PyTorch?

PyTorch is a Python-based library that provides maximum flexibility and speed. We’ve found PyTorch to be as simple as working with NumPy! You’ll figure this out inside the course for yourself.

We highly recommend learning PyTorch right now - it is quickly becoming the framework of choice for deep learning practitioners. PyTorch will be adopted by the industry soon as well so get on board today!
 
Why should you learn PyTorch?

PyTorch is one of the most popular and upcoming deep learning frameworks that allows you to build complex neural networks. It is rapidly growing among the research community and companies like Facebook and Uber are using it as well.
  Here is what Andrej Karpathy, head of AI at Tesla, has to say about PyTorch - “I've been using PyTorch a few months now and I've never felt better. I have more energy. My skin is clearer. My eyesight has improved.”
   
PyTorch vs. TensorFlow vs. Keras - which deep learning framework is the best?

This is a common question and a relevant one. There is no shortage of deep learning frameworks out there so which one should you choose?
  There’s no one-size-fits-all approach here. Each deep learning framework has its own unique set of features which is why data scientists go for one over the other.
  We recommend checking out this article on Analytics Vidhya to understand how PyTorch compares against the other deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras. This will help you settle the PyTorch vs. TensorFlow debate for sure!
 
What are the advantages of using PyTorch?

The main advantage of PyTorch is the imperative programming feature - which performs computations on your code as you are typing it, so debugging it is super easy! It is also much faster than NumPy and easy to learn too.
    What are some challenges you might face when using PyTorch?

PyTorch is not meant to be an end-to-end deep learning framework and using it for production in the industry remains a challenge. It is also relatively newer than other deep learning frameworks and has only recently released its stable versions.
    What kind of deep learning projects can you solve using PyTorch?

You can work on all sorts of deep learning projects using PyTorch! Here are a few examples:

Absolutely! While it’s still in its nascent stage, PyTorch is quickly becoming the go-to tool of choice for a lot of leading organizations. It’s flexible approach and easy-to-understand style have won over a lot of newcomers and industry veterans.
    Do you need to know deep learning to learn PyTorch?

No! PyTorch is a framework - you do not need to know deep learning to learn how it works. It will of course help you to learn both PyTorch and deep learning - they both go hand-in-hand to be truly effective.
 
Make sure you check out our popular Computer Vision using Deep Learning course to dive in depth into this subject.
    What kind of neural networks can you build using PyTorch?

PyTorch is an excellent framework for getting into actual machine learning and neural network building. In fact, in the course, we will be building a neural network from scratch using PyTorch. It is ideal for more complex neural networks like RNNs, CNNs, LSTMs, etc and neural networks you want to design for a specific purpose.
    Which programming language works best with PyTorch?

As the name suggests, PyTorch is built on Python. The flexibility and ease- of understanding comes from Python as you’ll see in this Introduction to PyTorch for Deep learning course.

What is Sentiment Analysis?
Sentiment Analysis or Opinion Mining is a technique used to analyse the emotion in a text. We can extract the attitude or the opinion of a piece of text and get insights on it. 
In the context of machine learning, you can think of Sentiment Analysis as a Classification problem where the text can either have a positive sentiment, a negative sentiment or a neutral one.

What are the applications of Sentiment Analysis in the industry?
In the age of social media, it is extremely common to comment about 
a movie you liked or 
a book you didn’t like or 
a product you bought was not up to the mark.
Therefore, a lot of companies use sentiment analysis for their products since it provides direct feedback of the customer’s opinion.
It is also important to detect and remove hateful content from social media and companies like Twitter, Facebook, etc. extensively use sentiment analysis on a daily basis.
  On what kind of projects would I implement sentiment analysis?
There are a wide variety of projects where you can use Sentiment Analysis. Here are a couple of popular use cases:
Sentiment Analysis can not only be used for customer reviews or product feedback, but in other domains as well.
Analyzing the sentiments on social media on the US Elections, for example, gives useful insights on which candidates are favoured by the public and which are not.
For other interesting problems involving sentiment/emotion detection, you can visit: https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/all/

What is the range of sentiments that can be observed and analysed?
In the earlier days of Natural language processing and Sentiment Analysis, the sentiments could hold only 2 or 3 values: Positive or Negative, and Positive, Neutral or Negative.
However, with the advent of deep learning, we can now recognize the subtle emotions in a text as well.
This has made tasks like Sarcasm detection, fake news detection etc. popular in research areas of Natural language processing 

Can I add this project to my resume and use it in my Interview?
Sentiment Analysis is one of the most popular applications of Machine Learning and Classification in Natural language processing
We also encourage you to take up more diverse datasets and apply sentiment analysis on them.
Sentiment Analysis is also one of the first projects you would learn in your Natural language processing journey and as such is commonly asked in interviews.

Common Questions Beginners ask about Pandas
What is Pandas?
Pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation library built in Python.

Pandas is THE most popular Python library in data science and the 4th most popular library in the world (according to StackOverflow’s global survey). The open source nature of Pandas isone of the primary reasons for its popularity and adoption rate in the community.

Here’s a golden nugget about Pandas from Wikipedia: The name ‘Pandas’ is derived from the term "panel data", an econometrics term for data sets that include observations over multiple time periods for the same individuals.
How can I install Pandas in Python?
The easiest way to install Pandas is to install it as part of the Anaconda distribution. Anaconda is free and easy to install (it’s the installer we use for setting up Python as well).

We highly recommend doing this instead of trying to install Pandas from scratch (it will be a slightly difficult process if you’re not familiar with Python or programming in general).

Most data science projects use Pandas to perform aggregating functions like GroupBy, merge and join dataframes, impute missing values in Python, among other things.

In short, Pandas is an essential part of a data science project!
What is a Pandas dataframe?
In Pandas, a dataframe is a data structure used to store and manipulate tabular data. The tabular data has it’s columns, column names and rows - we can easily perform operations on large dataframes using Pandas functions.

A Pandas dataframe is also the standard structure used to store the data from common formats of data like CSV file, Excel sheets and others.
How difficult is it to learn Pandas?
It’s actually quite straightforward! Even though Pandas has a ton of features and functions, you can easily pick those up with a bit of practice.

And that’s exactly how we’ve designed the course! You’ll learn all the different Pandas functions in Python and then work on various exercises after each lesson to solidify what you’ve learned.
Do I need to know Python to learn Pandas?
It would definitely help to have basic Python programming knowledge if you want to maximize your Pandas experience. The ability to merge or join Pandas dataframes, manipulating data and so on will require a bit of Python programming.

If you’re completely new to Python, we recommend taking our free Python for Data Science course.

Course Name : Evaluation Metrics for Machine Learning Models || Course Description : Evaluation Metrics for Machine Learning Models
What are evaluation metrics in machine learning? What are the different types of evaluation metrics? How do you gauge and improve your machine learning model? This course will teach you all about evaluation metrics for machine learning models!
Enroll for free
Evaluation Metrics are a Key Part of Machine Learning Models
Evaluation metrics form the backbone of improving your machine learning model. Without these evaluation metrics, we would be lost in a sea of machine learning model scores - unable to understand which model is performing well.
  Wondering where evaluation metrics fit in? Here’s how the typical machine learning model building process works:
We build a machine learning model (both regression and classification included)
Get feedback from the evaluation metric(s)
Make improvements to the model
Use the evaluation metric to gauge the model’s performance, and
Continue until you achieve a desirable accuracy
  Evaluation metrics, essentially, explain the performance of a machine learning model. An important aspect of evaluation metrics is their capability to discriminate among model results.
  If you’ve ever wondered how concepts like AUC-ROC, F1 Score, Gini Index, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Confusion Matrix work, well - you’ve come to the right course!
As a Machine Learning and Data Science aspirant, you need to be able to answer these questions about evaluation metrics:
What is an evaluation metric?
What are the different types of evaluation metrics?
Do I really need to master evaluation metrics to understand machine learning?
What kind of evaluation metrics questions can I expect in an interview?
How do evaluation metrics help me improve my hackathon rankings?
Can I use the same evaluation metrics for regression as well as classification problems?
Is cross validation an evaluation metric?
You will learn all about evaluation metrics for machine learning models in this course. We will discuss the different types of evaluation metrics, including how to use them for evaluating classification and regression models.
Enroll for free
When to use Evaluation Metrics in Machine Learning?
We have seen plenty of analysts and aspiring data scientists not even bothering to check how robust their machine learning model is. Once they are finished building a model, they hurriedly map predicted values on unseen data. This is an incorrect approach.
 Simply building a machine learning model is not the motive! It’s about creating and selecting a model which gives high accuracy on an out of sample data (or unseen data). Hence, it is crucial to check the accuracy of your model prior to computing predicted values.
 This is where evaluation metrics help us.

Common Questions Beginners Ask About Evaluation Metrics
What is an evaluation metric?
The answer lies in the name itself! Evaluation metrics help us evaluate, or gauge, the performance (or accuracy) of our machine learning model. They are an integral part of the machine learning model building pipeline as we can iterate and improve our model’s performance by judging how it’s working.
    What are the different types of evaluation metrics?
There are several types of evaluation metrics for machine learning models. The choice of the evaluation metric completely depends on the type of model and the implementation plan of the model.
  The evaluation metrics varies according to the problem types - whether you’re building a regression model (continuous target variable) or a classification model (discrete target variable).
  In this course, we’re covering evaluation metrics for both machine learning models. Here’s a taste of the different evaluation metrics you’ll find in the course:
Confusion Matrix (Classification evaluation metric)
F1 Score (Classification evaluation metric)
AUC-ROC (Classification evaluation metric)
Gini Coefficient (Classification evaluation metric)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE - Regression evaluation metric), and many more!
    Do I really need to master evaluation metrics to understand machine learning?
The short answer - yes. Evaluation metrics are critical to judging and improving our machine learning model’s performance. And who doesn’t want to do that?
  Evaluation metrics are a must-know concept for every machine learning and data science aspirant.
    What kind of evaluation metrics questions can I expect in an interview?
Here are a few common questions we’ve seen asked of beginners about evaluation metrics:
What are the different types of evaluation metrics for regression and classification problems?
Given a particular classification problem, should you use AUC-ROC or F1 Score (or something else)?
What is precision and recall? How does that help in evaluating your machine learning model?
What should you do if an evaluation metric is not working according to what you expected?
You’ll get a better idea about how to answer these questions inside the course.
    How do evaluation metrics help me improve my hackathon rankings?
Evaluation metrics, as you might have guessed by now, will be of supreme importance in machine learning hackathons. Your ranking on the hackathon leaderboard will be based on the evaluation metric being used in that hackathon.
  There’s no getting away from it - evaluation metrics are the lifeblood of your machine learning model’s performance.
    Can I use the same evaluation metrics for regression as well as classification problems?
Not quite. Regression and classification models have their separate evaluation metrics. Remember , the evaluation metric depends on the target variable. If your target variable is continuous (aka a regression problem), you can’t use a classification metric to evaluate it!
    Is cross validation an evaluation metric?
Cross validation is not technically an evaluation metric but we’ve still included this in the course. Cross Validation is one of the most important concepts in any type of machine learning model and a data scientist should be well versed in how it works.

Common Questions Beginners Ask About Dimensionality Reduction for Machine Learning
What is dimensionality reduction?
Dimension Reduction refers to the process of converting a set of data having vast dimensions into data with lesser dimensions ensuring that it conveys similar information concisely. These dimensionality reduction techniques are typically used while solving machine learning problems to obtain better features for a classification or regression task.
What are the different dimensionality reduction techniques?
There are multiple dimensionality reduction techniques for machine learning. We will cover 12 such techniques in this course:
Missing Value Ratio
Low Variance Filter
High Correlation Filter
Random Forest
Backward Feature Elimination
Forward Feature Selection
Factor Analysis
Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Independent Component Analysis
Methods Based on Projections
t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
UMAP
  Why should I learn dimensionality reduction?
That’s a fair question! Here are a few key reasons why every machine learning professional should know dimensionality reduction:
Space required to store the data is reduced as the number of dimensions comes down
Less dimensions lead to less computation/training time
Some algorithms do not perform well when we have large dimensions. So reducing these dimensions needs to happen for the algorithm to be useful
Dimensionality reduction also takes care of multicollinearity by removing redundant features.
We can visualize high dimensional data thanks to the various dimensionality reduction techniques such as t-SNE
We could go on, but you get the point! Dimensionality reduction is a crucial cog in the machine learning project lifecycle.
I already know what Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is. Do I really need to learn more dimensionality reduction techniques?
Absolutely. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a powerful dimensionality reduction technique but it does have its challenges. You should consider this course as a Siwss Army Knife in your dimensionality reduction skill set!
Learning the various dimensionality reduction techniques will help you become a better machine learning practitioner and expand your horizons when you’re working on different machine learning problems.
Do I need to have huge computational power to apply dimensionality reduction?
The question on computational power varies from the volume of data we have. For a dataset containing millions of records and thousands of dimensions one needs to have huge computational power to reduce the dimensions and make the data suitable for building models. 
Where as if the dataset contains only less records and dimensions the computational power required will be very less. It all depends on the volume of data and how quickly you want the result.
What are the different applications of dimensionality reduction?
There are a plethora of applications of dimensionality reduction. Here’s just 3 of them:
If the dataset has too many missing values, we use dimensionality reduction techniques  to reduce the number of variables
We can find the importance of each feature and keep the top most features, resulting in dimensionality reduction
We can use dimensionality reduction to find highly correlated features and drop them accordingly
There are a whole lot more as you’ll see inside the course.
What kind of machine learning projects can I apply dimensionality reduction on?
You can apply dimensionality reduction techniques on any dataset with a ton of variables. That does not mean you should do it without considering the challenges (more on that later)!
We suggest heading over to the DataHack platform and picking up a project to apply these dimensionality reduction techniques on. After all, practice makes perfect!
Will learning about dimensionality reduction and techniques like PCA help me in clearing machine learning interviews?
Of course! As a newcomer or fresher in machine learning, you’ll be asked about how you would deal with massive datasets. It’s a common interview question and your knowledge about dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and Factor Analysis will hold you in good stead.
Is dimensionality reduction a supervised or unsupervised machine learning technique?
Dimensionality reduction can be both supervised and unsupervised. The unsupervised techniques of Dimensionality Reduction is used when the dataset you have is humungous and is done prior to supervised dimensionality reduction technique. They include-
Principal Component Analysis
Random Projections
Feature Agglomeration
Supervised Dimensionality reduction techniques include methods like-
Linear Discriminant Analysis

What are the challenges of applying dimensionality reduction techniques?
The major challenges of applying dimensionality reduction includes-
Choosing the right variables from all the predictors is one of the most challenging tasks of dimensionality reduction. Wrong choice will lead to building a poor performing model.
The second challenge is the choice of dimensionality reduction techniques. Out of all the techniques that exist, dimensions of a dataset can be reduced using multiple dimensionality reduction technique and choosing the right one is really important to get the perfect analysis of data.
Ensuring possession of the right kind of system with appropriate computational power.

Common Questions Beginners Ask About the KNN Algorithm
What is the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm?

K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm is a distance based supervised learning algorithm that is used for solving classification problems. In this, we will be looking at the classes of the k nearest neighbors to a new point and assign it the class to which the majority of k neighbours belong too.
  To identify the nearest neighbors we use various techniques of measuring distance, the most common of them being the  ‘Euclidean Distance’.
   
Why should you learn KNN in machine learning?

KNN is among the most widely used and popular machine learning algorithms in the industry. Every data scientist, amateur or established, is expected to know the ins and outs of KNN. You should be able to implement it in Python or R (or any other programming language) if you want to land a role in the machine learning space.
  Additionally, as you’ll see in the course, KNN unlocks a lot of avenues to solving machine learning problems.
   
When should you use KNN?

KNN can be used for both classification and regression predictive problems. However, it is more widely used in classification problems in the industry.
   
Can I use KNN for both classification and regression problems?

Yes! We just answered the question above but let’s expand a bit more on that. To evaluate any technique we generally look at 3 important aspects:
Ease to interpret output
Calculation time
Predictive Power

Let us take a few examples to place KNN on the machine learning scale:
KNN algorithm fairs well across all parameters of considerations. It is commonly used for its ease of interpretation and low calculation time.
   
What kind of projects can you do using KNN?

You can perform both classification and regression projects. From predicting the price of a house (regression) to identifying if a loan will default or not (classification), you can apply KNN across a range of problems.
  We suggest heading to the DataHack platform, picking up a problem of your choice, and applying KNN there to solidify your practical understanding.
   
Do I need to learn Python or R (or any other programming language) to use KNN?

Well - yes and no. While KNN can still be performed on GUI based tools like KNIME, you should still have a working knowledge of how to implement it in Python or R. That’s a key consideration in the machine learning space.
   
Will machine learning project interviews ask you about KNN?

There’s a high chance you’ll be asked at least a couple of questions on the KNN algorithm. Depending on the level you’re applying for, you could be asked to explain how KNN works in a certain business scenario and how you would explain the results of a KNN model to a non-technical audience (a very common question!).
   
What does the ”K” in KNN stand for?

“K” in “KNN” stands for the number of cases that are considered to be "nearest" when you convert the cases as points in a euclidean space. 
That means, if we consider k=3, and when a new point has to be assigned a class, it will be on the basis of the classes of the 3 nearest points that surround the new point as per the euclidean distance.
   
How to calculate the distance between points in KNN?

There are various methods for calculating this distance, of which the most commonly known methods are – Euclidian, Manhattan (for continuous) and Hamming distance (for categorical). While other methods do exist, these are typically the most common ones and you’ll learn more about them in the course.

A Comprehensive Course on Ensemble Learning
Ensemble learning is a powerful machine learning algorithm that is used across industries by data science experts. The beauty of ensemble learning techniques is that they combine the predictions of multiple machine learning models.
 
You must have used or come across several of these ensemble learning techniques in your machine learning journey:
- Bagging
- Boosting
- Stacking
- Blending, etc.
 
These ensemble learning techniques include popular machine learning algorithms such as XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, among others. You must be getting a good idea of how vast and useful ensemble learning can be!
As a newcomer to Ensemble Learning in Machine Learning, you would need to know the below questions:
- What is Ensemble Learning?
- Why should you learn Ensemble Learning?
- What are the different types of Ensemble Learning techniques?
- Can you use Ensemble Learning for both Regression and Classification problems?
- What are the most popular Ensemble Learning techniques?
- What’s the intuition behind Bagging in Ensemble Learning?
- Similarly, what’s the idea behind Boosting in Ensemble Learning?
- What’s the difference between Bagging and Boosting?
- Do these Ensemble Learning techniques improve our machine learning model?
- Will learning Ensemble Learning help me crack machine learning interviews and win hackathons?
This course by Analytics Vidhya will introduce you to the concept of ensemble learning and understand the machine learning algorithms that use Ensemble Learning. To cement your understanding of this diverse topic, we will explain the advanced Ensemble Learning techniques in Python using a hands-on case study on a real-life problem!

What do you need to get started with the Ensemble Learning and Ensemble Learning Techniques course?

Common Questions Beginners Ask About Ensemble Learning What is Ensemble Learning?
Just like you come to a decision to buy a car by reading multiple reviews and opinions, in machine learning also, you can combine the decisions from multiple models to improve the overall performance. This technique of combining multiple machine learning models is called ensemble learning.
  Why do we need to know about Ensemble Learning?
Ensemble learning is one of the most effective ways to build an efficient machine learning model. You can build an ensemble machine learning model using simple models and yet get great scores which are at par with the resource-hungry models like neural networks.
  What are the different types of Ensemble Learning techniques?
There are simple and advanced ensemble learning techniques.
Simple:
Max Voting
Averaging
Weighted Averaging
Advanced
Stacking
Blending
Bagging
Boosting
In bagging and Boosting, there are other popular models like Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.
We will be covering all these techniques comprehensively and with Python code in this course.
  Do we use Ensemble Learning techniques only for classification or regression or both?
We can use ensemble learning for both types of machine learning problems: Classification and Regression. While techniques like Max Voting are used for classification, techniques like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc can be used for both Classification and Regression problems.
  What are the more popular ensemble learning techniques?
Ensemble learning techniques like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and variants, XGBoost, and LightGBM are extremely popular in hackathons. Depending on the data we are dealing with, we can use these techniques as our machine learning models. For example, you can use LightGBM(Light Gradient Boosting) for large datasets, or CatBoost for when your data has categorical variables.
  What is the intuition behind Bagging?
The idea behind bagging is combining the results of multiple models (for instance, all decision trees) to get a generalized result. Bagging (or Bootstrap Aggregating) technique uses subsets (bags) to get a fair idea of the distribution (complete set).

What is the intuition behind Boosting?
Boosting is a sequential process, where each subsequent model attempts to correct the errors of the previous model on subsets of the data. The succeeding models are dependent on the previous model. The boosting algorithm combines a number of weak learners to form a strong learner and boost your overall results.
  What is the difference between Bagging and Boosting?
While both bagging and boosting involve creating subsets, bagging makes these subsets randomly, while boosting prioritizes misclassified subsets. Additionally, at the final step in bagging, the weighted average is used, while boosting uses majority weighted voting.
  Does ensemble learning improve my machine learning model?
In a word, yes! And that too drastically! Ensemble learn can improve the results of your machine learning even exponentially at times. There are two major benefits of Ensemble models:
More accurate predictions(closer to the actual value)
Combining multiple simple models to make a strong model improves the stability of the overall machine learning model.
As you will learn in the course, we will take a real-life dataset and study how ensemble learning improves the score of our machine learning model as compared to using only simple models.
  Would knowing about ensemble learning help me crack interviews and hackathons?
Ensemble learning is the go-to method to achieve a high rank on hackathon leaderboards. You can go over the winning approaches of multiple hackathons, and there is a guarantee that a majority would have used an ensemble technique as their machine learning model.
Not only in hackathons but ensemble models are also used extremely popular in the industry because of how cost-effective they are. That is why, questions on random forest, gradient boosting, stacking, etc are often asked in interviews. Proposing an ensemble learning solution for a problem statement in an interview would always give you an edge over other solutions!

  Common Questions Beginners Ask About Linear Programming
What is linear programming?
As we discuss in the course: “Linear programming is a simple technique where we depict complex relationships through linear functions and then find the optimum points. The important word in the previous sentence is depict. The real relationships might be much more complex – but we can simplify them to linear relationships.”

Why should you learn linear programming?
I’m sure you’ve had this question ever since you came across linear programming. Well - here’s the good news. The use cases of linear programming are all around us.
We use linear programming in both our personal and professional fronts. We use linear programming when we are driving from home to work and want to take the shortest route. Or when we have a project delivery we make strategies to make our team work efficiently for on time delivery. You get the idea!

What are the different linear programming terminologies?
Here are the key terminologies you’ll come across when learning linear programming:
●    Decision variables
●    Objective function
●    Constraints
●    Non-negativity restriction
We will cover each of these terms in detail inside the course.

What programming languages should you know to apply linear programming?
We showcase how to solve a linear programming problem using R in the course. However, you don’t need to know programming to learn linear programming! As we show in the course, you can also use Excel and even manual methods to solve a typical linear programming problem.
In real life, you might need to rely a lot more on languages like R and Python since the dataset you’ll be working with might be too big for Excel.

Can I solve a linear programming problem using Microsoft Excel?
Of course! That’s another powerful aspect of linear programming - you don’t need to master a programming language to solve linear programming problems. The ‘OpenSolver’ feature of Excel works perfectly and is made for linear programming problems.

What kind of projects can you do using linear programming?
Any project that requires optimization can be used to apply linear programming. As you’ll see inside the course, we solve various types of linear programming problems, including a fascinating case study of a chocolate manufacturing business wanting to maximize its profits.

Interview questions - what to expect around linear programming?
This is an interesting question. Personally, this is a mixed round as far as data science interviews go. You might not get a direct question on linear programming, such as “How would you use linear programming to solve an optimization problem?”.
Instead, there’s a high probability of getting a case study like optimizing delivery routes. This is where your knowledge of linear programming will come in handy.
We have seen a lot of folks not paying attention to this branch of data science - and that’s a mistake. It’s an excellent tool to have at your fingertips and will make your life in the data science field a lot easier.

What are the applications of linear programming in real-life?
There are innumerable applications of linear programming in the real-world. Here are 4 key ones that you'll come across:
●    Manufacturing industries use linear programming for analyzing their supply chain operations
●    Organized retail for shelf space optimization
●    Optimizing Delivery Routes. Think Zomato, Swiggy, Amazon, Uber, Ola, etc.
●    Machine Learning algorithms!

Common Questions Beginners Ask About Naive Bayes
What is Naive Bayes?
In machine learning, the Naive Bayes is a classification algorithm based on the concept of Bayes Theorem. Bayes theorem is one of the fundamental theorems in probability. We will be learning all these concepts in the course quite thoroughly
  How are Naive Bayes and probability related?
The Bayes Theorem forms the backbone of the Naive Bayes algorithm. We use conditional probability to classify the data - thus, the Naive Bayes algorithm basically gives us the probability of a record being in a particular class, given the values of the features. This is nothing but conditional probability!
  What are the assumptions we need to keep in mind for using the Naive Bayes algorithm?
The most important assumption that Naive Bayes makes is that all the features are independent of each other. You might also need to convert the continuous variables into discrete variables. 

What are the different types of Naive Bayes algorithms?
There are 3 main types of Naive Bayes algorithms:
Gaussian Naive Bayes
Multinomial Naive Bayes
Bernoulli Naive Bayes
We will be covering all these techniques comprehensively and with Python code in this course.
   Can Naive Bayes be used only for binary classification?
Not at all - in fact, the Naive Bayes classifier is one of the most popular algorithms for multiclass classification. Depending on the data we are dealing with, we can use any of the 3 types of the Naive Bayes algorithms
  How does Naive Bayes hold up against other classification algorithms?
Though classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, random forest, etc are quite popular, Naive Bayes holds its own among them. It is faster than Random forest, since it can adapt to changing data pretty quickly. If the assumptions of Naive Bayes hold true, then it is much faster than logistic regression as well.
  What are the main advantages of Naive Bayes?
The main advantages are:
It is fast, and easy to understand
It is not prone to overfitting
It does not need much training data
  What are the main advantages of Naive Bayes?
Like all other algorithms, Naive Bayes has its own set of cons as well:
It does not work that well when the number of features is very high
The assumption that input features are independent of each other may not always hold true
You might lose important information while discretising the continuous variables.
  What are the applications of the Naive Bayes algorithm?
Though the algorithm is relatively simple to understand, you cannot underestimate the power of the Naive Bayes classifier! It is fast, intuitive, and is used for text classification tasks. Since it can be used for multiclass classification as well, it is considered a very versatile and flexible classifier. A majority of research papers on text classification start off by using the Naive Bayes classifier as the baseline model.

Common Questions Beginners Ask About Swift
We saw these questions earlier. Let’s quickly go through them one by one.
What is Swift?
Swift is an open-source programming language announced in 2014. Though it is a general-purpose language, it is fast gaining ground in the Data Science space.
  Are Swift and Python similar?
Though Swift and Python are different languages, they are similar in many ways. Both are open-source, though the Swift stack also has a different version for macOS users. Both swift and Python include some functional programming tools and a lot of the data structures in both Python and Swift are similar - like lists, tuples, dictionaries, etc.
  How is Swift different from Python?
The syntax of Swift is slightly different from that of Python. Just like Python, Swift was essentially developed by Apple as a holistic mobile application programming language, but its uses in Data Science and Machine Learning catapulted it to fame. The other differences are:
Swift is much faster than Python
Swift catches your error before runtime, unlike Python - where you catch your mistakes after the code has run
Python is essentially a wrapper on C, unlike Swift which is its own standalone language
  Why do I need to learn about Swift?
In the fast-evolving field of Data Science, it is important to stay updated on recent developments. Just like Python replaced R, there has been a slew of new programming languages geared towards speed and performance - Swift leads the pack here. Though much newer, it is now in the top 10 languages used by developers and the industry’s support for it only enhances the need for learning Swift.
  How can I use Swift for Data Science Purposes?
You need no better endorsement of technology than Google. One of the most popular machine learning frameworks, Tensorflow introduced a Swift for TensorFlow in 2018. This now combined with other Open Source libraries like SwiftAI, SwiftPlot, etc builds a powerful arsenal of tools for Data Science. Not only this, but for MacUsers, it is compatible with the CoreML library - you can now use it in Google Colab
  Can Swift be used for Deep Learning too?
In short, yes! Swift for Tensorflow(S4TF) library supports deep learning architectures in Swift. Along with CoreML, Swift also has pre-trained models for ComputerVision like ImageNet and ResNet, and GPT-2, BERT, etc for NLP
  What are some other unique features of Swift?
What if you could develop a mobile application which automatically tells you if it is a dog or a cat that you are looking at? Since Swift can be combined with CoreML, it can also be used for data science functionalities in mobile applications. Some other unique features are:
It is compatible with Python and C.This means that Python libraries like Numpy, Scikit-learn etc. can be easily used just by importing them in Swift
Other Python APIs can also be used with just importing Python
Apart from macOS, Swift can also be used in watchOS, tvOS, etc. So it can easily be the next big thing in IoT
  What are the main disadvantages of Swift?
There are some disadvantages of Swift as well.
The language is very new compared to a veteran language like Python - so it is still under continuous development
Since newer versions of Swift keep coming up, it tends to make development in Swift unstable

How is Swift being used in the industry?
Swift is being used by top companies both as a general-purpose programming language and for Data Science as well. Companies using Swift include Uber, Slack, Lyft, LinkedIn, etc. Stay ahead of the curve before the migration from Python happens by enrolling in this free tutorial!

Statistics is the study of the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organisation of data. For all the data science and machine learning enthusiasts it is paramount to be well versed with various statistical concepts such as Hypothesis testing
Every day we find ourselves testing new ideas, finding the fastest route to the office, the quickest way to finish our work, or simply finding a better way to do something we love. The critical question, then, is whether our idea is significantly better than what we tried previously.
These ideas that we come up with on such a regular basis – that’s essentially what a hypothesis is. And testing these ideas to figure out which one works and which one is best left behind, is called hypothesis testing.
  Statistics is the Grammar of Data Science
The course is structured in a manner that you will get ample of examples in each module. You’ll get to learn all about
Fundamentals of Hypothesis Testing: The course begins with a simple-to-understand example on hypothesis testing. This chapter will clear all your basics like - Null Hypothesis, Alternative Hypothesis, Type 1 Error, Type 2 Error, and Significance Level.

What is the Z Test? The course introduces the most basic type of testing a hypothesis - Z test. Z tests are a statistical way of testing. The chapter covers the one sample as well as the two sample Z test.
What is the t-Test? The t-test is another test for validating the hypothesis. The chapter begins with a unique example and later covers both the one-sample and two-sample t-test.
Deciding between the Z Test and t-Test Are you confused on how to use these tests? Don’t worry, the course comprises a simple step-by-step guide on choosing the best test for your experiment.
